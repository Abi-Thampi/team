This is where we present ourselves and what we work on.

## Paul Freeman
I am helping to setup this repository.

Please ask me if you have questions.

## Fred Vanholsbeeck
I am in charge of this directory for one week (14-21 Nov 2018)

I will set up some of the projects and try to get this repository up and running. 

Will choose the next volunteer so everyone has a turn.
